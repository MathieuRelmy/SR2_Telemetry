# SR2_Telemetry
W.I.P. Creates TXT files that can be read by OBS to broadcast telemetry with minimal in-game coding (only a few blocks). You only need SR2Logger. Instructions on how to use will be given once the script is deemed working.

Main goal of this is to achieve something that looks like Telemachus, a KSP mod used to display telemetry like a real mission control ops software.

# SR2_Telemetry
W.I.P. Creates TXT files that can be read by OBS to brodcast telemetry without using any in game UI with Vizzy. You only need SR2Logger. Instructions on how to use will be given once the script is deemed working.

Main goal of this is to achieve something that looks like Telemachus, a KSP mod used to display telemetry like a real mission control ops software.
